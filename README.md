To view the methods and results of the analysis, open 'analysis_main.html' in any web browser. To manipulate the code in a RMarkdown document, open 'analysis_main.Rmd' in RStudio. As described in the document, the recommended workflow for reproducing our analysis is to begin by loading all proxy data from the provided .RData file, and then proceeding with the analysis. Alternatively, individual datasets can be loaded using the "load_indv_data.R" script before proceeding with the analysis in 'analysis_main'.
