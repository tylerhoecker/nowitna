## Build composite biomass burning recrod from individual records (no peak 
## analysis or interpolation, raw charcoal count data). 
## Execute the method for building a composite biomass burning record used 
## in Kelly et al. 2013 (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1305069110). The method estimates 
## the parameters of a zero-inflated log-normal (ZIL) distribution of pooled 
## charcoal counts in continuous moving windows of a user-defined width. 
## In this analysis, 5-year and 50-year window widths are used 
## (2.5 and 25 half-kernel widths, respectively).

## This portion of the analysis is relegated to a separate R script for 
## clarity of the workflow. Window widths and other parameters can be manipulated within the 'analysis_composite.r' script.
